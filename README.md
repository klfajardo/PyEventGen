# PyEventGen
PyEventGen is a flexible and open-source tool designed for generating fictitious events, intended to simulate traffic and activity on information and event monitoring systems. It is especially useful for developers and system administrators who need to generate simulated data for software testing or training on monitoring tools like SIEM.

# Features
- Dynamic generation of fictitious events based on user-defined queries.
- Integration with MongoDB to effectively manage and manipulate data.
- Event export in multiple formats including JSON and log records, with future implementations for XML, CSV and others.
- Configuration and management of users and servers through an interactive console.
- Logging system to monitor and record operations performed by the system.

# Why is this project useful?
- By simulating a variety IT security events, this tool enables users to rigorously test how their SIEM systems and other monitoring tools respond to varied and complex scenarios.
- The tool can generate large volumes of simulated events quickly, allowing users to test and stress their systems without the need for real data.
- Programmers can use this tool to understand better how to interact with databases like MongoDB, implement CRUD operations, and develop efficient data parsing techniques.
- The tool provides a fictitious sandbox environment for experimenting with data structures, algorithms, and system design. This is particularly useful for students and professionals in computer science who need a practical way to apply theoretical concepts.
- Users can customize the types and volumes of data generated, making it a flexible tool for various testing and development needs.
